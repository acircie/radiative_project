# radiative_project
Final Project for the Radiative Processes Class.
The goal of the project is to reproduce a toy model for the spectrum of a Blazar, 
with tweakable parameters.

The spectra are computed using the agnpy package ([docs](https://agnpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)),
which is based on the results from [Finke et al. (2008)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...686..181F/abstract) and [Dermer and Menon (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009herb.book.....D/abstract)
I use this package to carry out the computation of Synchrotron emission and Synchrotron-Self-Compton emission from a spherical region filled with relativistic electrons with a power-law distribution of energies.
