# radiative_project
Final Project for the Radiative Processes Class.
The goal of the project is to reproduce a toy model for the spectrum of a Blazar, 
with tweakable parameters to show how the emission depends on the properties of the jet and 
its inclination from the line of sight.

An outline of the project running on colab can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AyK1ziMVhhf6KXTRsbTPu3JsLB648nqB?usp=sharing)
